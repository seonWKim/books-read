- Berkeley DB is an embedded database

# In the Beginning

- Developed by Margo Seltzer and Keith Bostic
- Berkeley DB project began with the modest goal of replacing the in-memory hsearch hash package and on the
  on-disk dbm/ndbm hash packages with a new and improved hash implementation able to operate both in-memory and
  on disk
- It is vital for any complex software packages's testing and maintenance that the software be designed and
  built as a cooperating set of modules with-defined API boundaries.
